                <h2> Augmented Reality on the Web</h2>
                <p>Augmented Reality is the technology that makes possible to add overlayed content on the real world.
                    It can be provided for several type of devices: handleheld (like mobile phones), headsets, desktop
                    displays, and so on.
                    For handleheld devices (more in general, for video-see-through devices) the 'reality' is captured
                    from one or more cameras and then
                    shown on the device display, adding some kind of content on top of it.</p>

                    <p>To have a quick look at some Augmented Reality, you can watch the video playing in loop on the
                        <a class="inline" href="/me">homepage</a>
                    </p>

                <h2>Why the Web</h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented Reality on the Web opens an entire new world of opportunities, for both developers and
                    users.
                    The Web is collaborative and the better place for everybody to unlueash their creativity in an easy
                    and fast way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For developers, to develop Augmented Reality ('AR' from now on) on the Web means to avoid all the
                    Mobile app developement
                    efforts and costs related to App stores (validation, time to publish). Also, it means to re-use well
                    known technologies
                    like Javascript, HTML and CSS, known from a lot of developers and non-developers (like web
                    designers).
                    It basically means that is possible to release every new version instantly, to fix bugs or release
                    new features
                    in near real-time, opening a lot of pratical possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For users, it means to reach an AR experience just visiting a website. As QR Codes are now
                    widespread, it's
                    also possible to scan a QR Code and reach the URL without even type.

                    Addictionally, users do not have to reserve storage space on their device to download the AR app,
                    and do not have
                    to keep it updated.
                </p>

                <h2>What is possible to achieve</h2>

                Using AR.js, a-frame and three.js, it's possible to create Web AR experiences that features three kind
                of AR:

                <p>
                    <h3>2D picture based (NFT based)</h3>

                    When a 2D images is found by the camera, it's possible to show some kind of content on top of it, or
                    near it. The content
                    can be a 2D image, a GIF, a 3D model (also animated) and a 2D video too. Examples of use: Augmented
                    Art, learning (Augmented books),
                    Augmented flyers, advertising, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Marker based</h3>

                    When a marker is found by the camera, it's possible to show some content (same as above). Markers
                    are very stable
                    but limited in shape, color and size. It is suggested for those kind of AR experiences where are
                    required
                    a lot of different markers with different content. Examples of use: learning (Augmented books),
                    Augmented flyers, advertising.

                    <p>
                        An interesting feature about Markers comes when creating QR Codes that contain a marker: this way,
                        with only one figure, we can provide to the user a way to reach the website and also
                        the 'shape' to scan in order to see the AR content.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Location based</h3>

                    This kind of AR uses real-world places in order to show Augmented Reality
                    content, on the user device.
                    The experiences that can be built with this library are those that make uses of users position in
                    the real world. The user can move (ideally outdoor) and through their smartphones they can see AR
                    content where places are in the real world. Moving around and rotating the phone will make the AR
                    content change according to users position and rotation (so places are ‘sticked’ in their real
                    position, and appear bigger/thinner according to their distance from the user).
                    <p>
                        With this solution it’s possible to build experiences like interactive support for touristic
                        guides,
                        support when exploring a new city, find places of interest like buildings, museums, restaurants,
                        hotels and so on. It’s also possible to build learning experiences like treasure hunts and
                        biology or history learning games, or
                        use this technology for situated art (visual art experiences bound to specific real world
                        coordinates). Mixing location based and marker based/2D picture based can open a world of
                        possibilities to create
                        dynamic AR games/experiences.
